# Kenshi Polish Translation
This is a public repository of Polish translation for game Kenshi. The development of following code is maintained by FLATlabs organization. 

The aim of this translation mod is to make every dialogue and text line appear in Polish, without breaking any type of immersion the original language could generate. They might be not exact and differences between word swaps and names may appear, yet it's been done for sake of a more understandable gameplay and lore.

**Where can you download the translation**
- from [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2371787869)
- from [ModDB](https://www.moddb.com/mods/polish-localization)
- from [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/kenshi/mods/529)
- and from this repo

**Instruction describing the process of installation can be found inside mod files**.

## What's Kenshi
Kenshi is "*a free-roaming squad based RPG focusing on open-ended sandbox gameplay features rather than a linear story. Be a trader, a thief, a rebel, a warlord, an adventurer, a farmer, a slave, or just food for the cannibals*". There's no narrator to tell you where to go. No task tab or journal to manage what to do. Every death is permanent and no coming back after decisions you've made. Kenshi is an unforgiving yet exciting and satisfying game.

You can check out the demo and/or buy the game [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/233860/Kenshi/).
